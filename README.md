# RestaurantSimulator-Cplusplus
I made this project in c++, using concepts such as: constructor, destructor, access methods, operator overloading, inclusion of classes, text files, binary files, csv files, STL containers (vector, map, list, set), regex , virtual functions.
In the console, the user can enter his dishes (separate menus for Main Course, Starter, Pizza, Pasta) and drinks, view the order, delete what he does not want to order, and access a section with frequently asked questions. After confirming the order, he must log in based on an email taken from the CSV file, attempts allowed for email and password: 3. The passwords were encrypted in a text file based on the algorithm: add 3 of each character, placed with a new line and put 0 at the end of the password. After placing the order, it can also add feedback stored in a string pair map, int.
The application also generates various reports that are constantly updated, which can be viewed in text files and in the console. These are related to: security (regarding the number of successful and failed logins), feedback (based on what the users entered, making an average of the notes), frequent questions (which were the most accessed questions), turnover (determining the profit by subtracting the expenses from a text file), clients (the list with the data related to the clients, but also the number of accounts created in a certainÂ period).
